Land-Rover Project

The main aim of this project is to control a bot run by the Beagle Bone Black over wi-fi.

The bot consists of 2 dc motors for movement and a robotic arm with 4 degrees of freedom that can pick up small objects (upto 1‚Äù cube) carry it. The BBB drives the bot. A socket connection is established via a wi-fi dongle connected to the usb port of the BBB.

The socket server code runs on the BBB and the client code runs on the computer. The client code needs nurses.h to compile and work.

ncurses.h can be obtained by using the following command:

sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
or
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Controls:
The forward, backward, left and right movement of the bot itself is controlled by the arrow keys.
The arm movement is controlled by:
a- Shoulder Left
z- Shoulder Right
d- elbow Up
c- elbow Down
s- Shoulder Up
x- Shoulder Down
g- Jaw Open
b- Jaw Close

For simple GPIO commands like export and set value code by Derek Molly has been used.

About the socket_server_with_camera
UDP was used to stream video to the VLC Player on the client PC through ethernet.
For the camera capture v4l2 library was used to talk to the uvc video driver.
We used Derek Molly's BoneCV to do the above.
